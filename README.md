# RPSLearner: A novel approach combining <ins>R</ins>andom <ins>P</ins>rojection and <ins>S</ins>tacking <ins>Learn</ins>ing for categorizing NSCLC

In this study, to address the concerns in NSCLC subtype prediction, we developed RPSLearner which combines RP and stacking learning for effective and accurate classification. It effectively reduced the dimensionality while preserving sample-to-sample distances through RP and integrated fused features and predictions from diverse models through stacking learning. RPSLearner succeeds in boosting classification prediction with higher accuracy, F1 and AUC metrics than conventional machine learning models and state-of-the-art methods. RPSLearner utilized feature fusion strategy which exhibited better performance than score ensemble approaches in subtype prediction. RPSLearnerâ€™s results are interpretable that the expression of DEGs aligns well with the published literature, which also offering insights about potential novel biomarkers. This framework could be potentially extended to subtype identification of other cancers.

How to use the method for RNA-seq data

```python
# Usage Example for RPSLearner

import pandas as pd
from RPSLearner import RPSLearner
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score

data = pd.read_csv('data/rnaseq_tcga.csv')

tpm = data.drop('Subtype', axis=1)
subtype = data['Subtype'] # Use '0' for LUAD, and '1' for LUSC

metrics, y_probs, y_labels = RPSLearner(
    tpm.values, subtype, n_jobs=5)
```
